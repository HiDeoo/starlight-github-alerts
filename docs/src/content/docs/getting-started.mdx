A [Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build) plugin to render [GitHub alerts](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#alerts) as [Starlight asides](https://starlight.astro.build/components/asides/) in your Markdown and MDX content.

Check out the [demo](/demo/) for a preview of the plugin in action.

## Prerequisites

You will need to have a Starlight website set up.
If you don't have one yet, you can follow the ["Getting Started"](https://starlight.astro.build/getting-started/) guide in the Starlight docs to create one.

## Installation

import { Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components'
import { PackageManagers } from '@hideoo/starlight-plugins-docs-components'
import { Preview } from '@hideoo/starlight-plugins-docs-components'

<Steps>

1. Starlight GitHub Alerts is a Starlight [plugin](https://starlight.astro.build/reference/plugins/). Install it using your favorite package manager:

   <PackageManagers pkg="starlight-github-alerts" />

2. Add the plugin to your Starlight [configuration](https://starlight.astro.build/reference/configuration/#plugins) in the `astro.config.mjs` file.

   ```js title="astro.config.mjs" ins={4,9}
   // @ts-check
   import starlight from '@astrojs/starlight'
   import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config'
   import starlightGitHubAlerts from 'starlight-github-alerts'

   export default defineConfig({
     integrations: [
       starlight({
         plugins: [starlightGitHubAlerts()],
         title: 'My Docs',
       }),
     ],
   })
   ```

3. [Start the development server](https://starlight.astro.build/getting-started/#start-the-development-server) to preview GitHub alerts rendered as Starlight asides.
